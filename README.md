Classification of NBA players, in order to maximize precision. 

To achieve this, I choose a decision threshold that maximizes the F 0.5 score.

# This repository contains:
- the data,
- a data analysis,
- a modelision file,
- and an API REST file.

# NB:
The code files may contain errors. They have been modified several times. My goal with this repository is to keep files with a methodology using an f-beta score and a confusion matrix.
